# Epidemic

This is an interactive epidemic visualizer tool. I wrote it as I was working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. It allows you to see a high level approximation of how an illness would spread through a population. Try running it at default settings to learn what to expect from it. Once comfortable, feel free to change the settings to simulate different scenarios.
